# Media Handling

Mercury downloads media attachments from chat platforms, saves them to the workspace's inbox, and passes them to the agent. The agent can also produce files via the `outbox/` directory.

## Inbox (Incoming)

Incoming media is saved to the conversation's workspace:

```
workspaces/<name>/inbox/<timestamp>-<filename>
```

Examples:
```
workspaces/acme/inbox/
├── 1741243200000-photo.jpg
├── 1741243500000-voice.ogg
└── 1741244000000-report.pdf
```

The agent receives attachments as XML in the prompt:

```xml
<attachments>
  <attachment type="image" path="inbox/1741243200000-photo.jpg" mime="image/jpeg" size="12345" />
</attachments>
```

## Outbox (Outgoing)

The agent writes files to `outbox/` during a run. After the agent exits, the runtime scans for files with `mtime >= startTime` and attaches them to the reply:

```
workspaces/<name>/outbox/
├── chart.png
└── summary.pdf
```

Previous outbox files are not deleted — only files created or modified during the current run are sent.
